Hello Worlds
============

A simple Spring Data Neo4j example with just enough code to
do something that works.

This version of the project takes advantage of the niceties
provided by spring-data-neo4j-aspects, which enhances the
Plain Old Java Objects into Deluxe Aspect Java Objects. 

Build and Run
-------------

`mvn clean package exec:java`
