    <title>Oh the Glamour - More UI</title>
    <para>
        To create a nice user experience, we wanted to have a nice looking app, not something that looked like a toddler
        made it. So we got some UX people involved and the results were impressive. This sections presents some of the
        remaining screenshots of cineasts.net.
    </para>
    <para>
        Some of the noteworthy things. As Spring Data Graph does a read-through to the datastore for property and relationship
        access we tried to minimize that by using <code>&lt;c:var/&gt;</code> several times.
        The app contains very little javascript / ajax code right now, that will change when it moves ahead.
