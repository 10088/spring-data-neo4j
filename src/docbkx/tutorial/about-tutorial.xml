    <title>Allow me to introduce - Cineasts.net</title>
    <para>
Once upon a time I wanted to build a social movie database myself. First things first - I had a name: "Cineasts" - the people
crazy about movies. So I went ahead and bought the domain, cineasts.net. So, the project was almost done.

I had some ideas as well. Of course there should be Actors who play Roles in Movies. I needed the Cineast, too, someone
had to rate the movies after all. And while they were there, they could also make friends. Find someone to accompany them to the cinema or share
movie preferences. Even better, the engine behind all that could recommend new friends and movies to them, derived from their interests and
existing friends.

</para><para>I looked for possible sources for data, IMDB was my first stop, but they charge 15k for data usage. Fortunately I found themoviedb.org which has
liberal terms and conditions and a nice API for fetching the data.

There were many more ideas but I wanted to get something done over the course of one day. So this was the scope I was going to tackle.        * What is Cineasts.net
