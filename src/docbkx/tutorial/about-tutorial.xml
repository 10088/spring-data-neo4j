    <title>Allow me to introduce - Cineasts.net</title>
    <para>
Once upon a time we wanted to build a social movie database. First things first - we had a name: "Cineasts" - the cinema enthusiasts who are
crazy about movies. So we went ahead and got the domain, cineasts.net and the project was almost complete.
</para><para>
We had some ideas about the domain too. Of course there should be actors who play roles in movies. We needed the Cineast, too, someone
to rate the movies. And while they were there, they could also make friends. Find someone to accompany them to the cinema or share
movie preferences. Even better, the engine behind all that should recommend new friends and movies to cineasts, based on their interests and
existing friends.

</para><para>When we looked for possible sources for data, IMDB was our first stop, but they're a little expensive for our tastes, charging 15k USD for data access. Fortunately we found <ulink url="http://themoviedb.org">TheMoviedb.org</ulink> which provides user-generated data for free. The also have liberal terms and conditions and a nice API for fetching the data.

There were many more ideas but we wanted to get something done quickly. And this is how it should look.
