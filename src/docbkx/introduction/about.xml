    <title>About this guide book</title>
    <para>
        Welcome to the Spring Data Graph Guide Book. Thank you for taking the time to get an in depth look
        into <ulink url="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-graph">Spring Data Graph</ulink>.
        This project is part of the <ulink url="http://springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data project</ulink>,
        which brings the convenient programming model of the Spring Framework to modern NOSQL databases.
 		Spring Data Graph, as the name alludes to, aims to provide support for graph databases. It currently
        supports <ulink url="http://neo4j.org">Neo4j</ulink>.

        It was written by developers for developers. Hopefully we've created a document that is well received
        by our peers.

        This book is presented as a <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuplexBook.html">duplex book</ulink>,
        a term coined by Martin Fowler. A duplex book consists of at least two parts. The first part is an easily
        accessible tutorial that gives the reader an overview of the topics contained in the book. It contains lots
        of examples and discussion topics. This part of the book is highly suited for cover-to-cover reading.

        We chose a tutorial describing the creation of a web application that allows movie enthusiasts to
        find their favorite movies, rate them, connect with fellow movie geeks, and enjoy social features such as
        recommendations. The application is running on Neo4j using Spring Data Graph and the well-known Spring
        Web Stack.
    </para>

        The second part of the book is the classic reference documentation, containing detailed information about
        the library. It discusses the programming model, the underlying assumptions, and internals, as well as the
        APIs for the object-graph mapping. The reference documentation is typically used to look up concrete bits of
        information, or to drill down into certain topics. For hackers wanting to really delve into Spring Data
        Graph, it can of course also be read cover-to-cover.
