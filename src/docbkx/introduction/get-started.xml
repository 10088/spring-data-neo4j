    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>NOSQL databases have only recently come to prominence, even though some of them have existed for a few years now.
	That's why this document will not only guide you through the relevant parts of the Spring Data Graph
	API, but also explain some key concepts of graph databases.
	</para>
	<para>
		After reading this document, you should be able to integrate Spring Data Graph into your applications.
		If there are any inaccuracies, issues or if you just think the explanations are too complicated, please feed that back to us. Your input will also benefit future readers of this documentation. For details on how to get help
		and provide feedback, see <xref linkend="get-started:help"/>.

		<title>First Steps</title>
		
		<para>As explained in <xref linkend="why-sd-graph"/>, Spring Data Graph provides integration
		between the Spring framework and graph databases. As we said in the introduction <xref linkend="introduction"/>, familiarity with the Spring framework is assumed to get the most out of this book.
		But we will explain graph databases and Neo4j in particular in a little more detail.
		The main focus of this document is to explain the steps needed to get an interesting Spring Data Graph application up and running.

			<title>Knowing Spring</title>
			<para>Spring Data Graph makes heavy use of Spring Framework's <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/spring-core.html">core</ulink> functionality,
			such as the <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/beans.html">IoC</ulink> container,
			<ulink url="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/validation.html#core-convert">converter</ulink> API and the 
			<ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/aop.html">AOP</ulink> infrastructure. While it is less important
			to know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is essential.
			The Spring Framework documentation
			<ulink url="http://www.springsource.org/documentation">home page</ulink> is a good starting point for
			developers who want to become more familiar with the Spring Framework.</para>

		<section id="get-started:first-steps:nosql">
			<title>Knowing NOSQL and graph databases</title>
			<para>The recent interest in NOSQL databases has been driven by the need to find the better storage solutions for different kinds of data and access patterns. The NOSQL mantra is that databases should fit the data, not the other way round. 
				The NOSQL space is overflowing with interesting and useful technology. But as a consequence, each store tends to implement its own data access API, leading to a steep learning curve for developers intent on using polyglot persistence. Spring Data aims to ease this burden by
				providing consistent abstractions over those underlying data access APIs.
			</para>
			<para>
				Graph databases are a particularly good fit for large networks of connected information (objects). They map objects to nodes and connections to
				relationships. Examples of such datasets are social networks, geospatial information, network layouts, and hardware or dependency graphs.
				Neo4j is the first graph database that is tightly integrated with the Spring Data Graph project.

			<title>Trying Out The Samples</title>
			<para>Spring Data Graph comes with a number of <ulink url="http://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-graph-examples">samples</ulink>
				and unit test cases (if you accessed the sources via 
				<ulink url="http://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-graph">github</ulink> or Maven).
