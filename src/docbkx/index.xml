        <title>About this Guide Book</title>
        <para>
            Welcome to the Spring Data Graph Guide Book. Thank you for taking the time to get an in depth look into the
            usage and workings of the <ulink url="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-graph">Spring Data Graph Library</ulink>. Spring Data Graph is part of the <ulink url="http://springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data project</ulink> which
            aims to provide the convenient programming model of the Spring Framework to the big field modern datastores
            (mostly NoSQL). Spring Data Graph in particular currently provides integration for the <ulink url="http://neo4j.org">Neo4j Graph Database</ulink>.
        </para><para>
            It was written by developers for developers. So hopefully we created a documentation that is well received by
            our peers.
        </para><para>
            If you have any feedback to the Spring Data Graph Library or this book, please provide it via <ulink url="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAGRAPH">SpringSource JIRA</ulink>,
            the <ulink url="http://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?f=80">SpringSource NoSQL Forum</ulink>, <ulink
            url="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-graph/issues">github comments or issues</ulink> or the <ulink url="http://neo4j.org/community/list/">Neo4j mailing list</ulink>.
        </para><para>
            This book is presented as a <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuplexBook.html">duplex book</ulink>, a term coined by Martin Fowler. A duplex book consists of at least two
            parts. The first part is an easily accessible narrative, that gives the reader an overview of the topics contained
            in the book. It contains lots of examples and more general discussion topics. This should be the only part of
            the book that is required to be read cover-to-cover.
        </para><para>
        We chose a tutorial describing the creation of a web applicaton (cineasts.net) that allows movie enthusiasts to
        find the favorites, rate them, connect with each other and enjoy social features. The application is running on
        Neo4j using Spring Data Graph and the well known Spring Web Stack.
    </para><para>
            The second part is the classic reference documentation containing the detailed information about the library.
            It discusses the programming model, the underlying assumptions, used toolset (like aspectj) as well as the APIs
            for the object-graph mapping and the template approach. The reference docs should be mainly used to look up
            concrete bits of information or to dig deeper into certain topics.
        </para>

    <part id="tutorial">
        <title>Tutorial</title>
        <partintro>
            <para>
                In this first part of the book we run a tutorial that creates a complete web application built on top of Spring Data Graph.
                It uses a domain that should be familiar to most - movies. So for cineasts.net we decided to add a social
                touch to the whole movie rating business, allowing friends to share their ratings and get recommendations
                for new friends and movies.
            </para><para>
            The tutorial is presented as a colloquial description of the steps necessary to create the application.
            It provides the configuration and code examples that are needed to understand what's happening. The complete
            source code repository for running the app is available on <ulink url="http://github.com/jexp/cineasts">github</ulink>.
