        The Spring Data Graph project, as part of the Spring Data initiative, aims to simplify development
        with graph databases. Like JPA, it uses annotations on simple POJO beans. The annotations activate
        the AspectJ aspects in the Spring Data Graph framework, mapping the POJO entities and their fields
        to nodes, relationships, and properties in the graph database.

        Spring Data Graph allows anytime to drop down to the Neo4j-API level to execute functionality with
        the highest performance possible. For Integration of Neo4j and Grails/GORM please refer to the Neo4j
        <ulink url="http://www.grails.org/plugin/neo4j">grails plugin</ulink>.

        To get started with a simple application, only the basic annotations
        (see <xref linkend="reference:programming-model:annotations"/>) and the additional aspect-introduced
        entity methods (see <xref linkend="reference:programming-model:introduced-methods"/>) are required.
        Basic knowledge of graph stores is needed to access advanced functionality like traversals.

               As Spring Data Graph is based on AspectJ and uses some advanced features of that toolset, please
                be aware of that. Please see the section on AspectJ (<xref linkend="reference:aspectj"/>) for
                details if you run into any problems.
