        The Spring Data Graph project, as part of the Spring Data initiative, aims to simplify development
        with graph databases. Like JPA, it uses annotations on simple POJO beans. The annotations activate
        the AspectJ aspects in the Spring Data Graph framework, mapping the POJO entities and their fields
        to nodes, relationships, and properties in the graph database.

        To get started with a simple application, only the basic annotations
        (see <xref linkend="reference:programming-model:annotations"/>) and the additional aspect-introduced
        entity methods (see <xref linkend="reference:programming-model:introduced-methods"/>) are required.
        Basic knowledge of graph stores is needed to access advanced functionality like traversals.
