    <title>Overview of the AspectJ support</title>
    <para>Behind the scenes Spring Data Graph leverages <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</ulink>
        (<xref linkend="reference_aspectj-intro"/>)
        aspects to modify the behavior of simple POJO entities to be able to be backed by a graph store.
        Each node entity is backed by a graph node that holds its properties and relationships to other entities.
        AspectJ is used to intercept field access and to retrieve the information from the backing node
        (either its properties or relationships or dynamic traversals starting from the node).

        For relationship entities the fields are similarly mapped to properties.
        There are two specially annotated fields for the start and the end node of the relationship.
    </para>
    <para>
        The aspect introduces some internal fields and some public methods (<xref linkend="reference:programming-model:introduced-methods"/>)
        to the entities for accessing the backing
        state via <code>getPersistentState()</code> and creating relationships with <code>relateTo</code>
        and retrieving relationship entities via <code>getRelationshipTo</code>. It also introduces graphRepository methods like
        <code>find(Class&lt;? extends NodeEntity&gt;, TraversalDescription)</code>
        and equals and hashCode delegation.
    </para>
    <para>
        Spring Data Graph internally uses an abstraction called <code>EntityState</code> that the field access and instantiation
        advices of the aspect delegate to, keeping the aspect code very small and focused to the pointcuts and
        delegation code. The <code>EntityState</code> then uses a number of <code>FieldAccessorFactories</code>
        to create a <code>FieldAccessor</code> instance per field that does the specific handling needed for the concrete field type.

        <title>IDE-AspectJ Support</title>
        <para>
            As Spring Data Graph uses some advanced aspects of AspectJ, there might be issues with IDE reporting errors
            where there are none. Features that might be reported are: introduction of methods to interfaces, declaration
            of additional interfaces for annotated classes, generified introduced methods.
        </para>
        <para>
            Eclipse and STS support AspectJ via the AJDT plugin which can be installed from the update-site:

        <para>
            The AspectJ support in IntelliJ IDEA lacks some of the features. JetBrains is working to improve the situation
            with the upcoming 10.5 release of the IDE (which is currently available as EAP). Building the project with
            <code>Ajc</code> works in the IDE (Options -> Compiler -> Java-Compiler should show Ajc, please add
            512 MB RAM for the compiler to run).
