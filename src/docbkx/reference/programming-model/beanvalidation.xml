    <title>Bean validation (JSR-303)</title>
    <para>
        Spring Data Graph supports property based validation support. So, whenever a property is changed, it is
        checked against the annotated constraints (.e.g @Min, @Max, @Size, etc).
        Validation errors throw a ValidationException. For evaluating the constraints the validation support that
        comes with Spring is used. To use it a validator has to be registered with the GraphDatabaseContext, if there
        is none, no validation will be performed (any registered Validator or (Local)ValidatorFactoryBean will be
        used).
