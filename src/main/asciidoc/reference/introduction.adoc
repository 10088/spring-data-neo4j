Spring Data Neo4j has been rewritten between versions 3.5 and 4.  In order to understand what Spring Data Neo4j can do it's important to understand
how an SDN application is structured and could have implications in how you design your application.

[[reference.components]]
== Components


SDN 3.x was monolithic in a sense that all mapping code, database drivers and Spring integrations were all in one.  SDN 4 has decided to
break these components up into:

* ***Drivers***: At the moment these come in 3 variants: Embedded, HTTP and the binary protocol Bolt.
* ***The Object Graph Mapper (OGM)***: This is similar to an ORM in that it maps database nodes to java objects. This library is agnostic of any framework (including Spring).
* ***Spring Data Neo4j 4***: Provides syntactic sugar and code on top of the OGM to help quickly build Spring Based Neo4j/OGM apps.

Those coming from other Spring Data projects or are familiar with ORM products like JPA or Hibernate may quickly recognise this architecture.
A bulk of the heavy lifting has been moved into the OGM.

[NOTE]
It's therefore worth noting that there *will be backward compatibility issues* when migrating to version 4.x, so be sure to check the <<migration,Migration Guide>> to avoid any unwanted surprises.

== How to use this reference


Spring Data Neo4j is largely broken up into two main components:

- <<reference.ogm-support, OGM Support>>: Provides close integration between Spring Data and the OGM; the main underlying technology used in SDN.
- <<mongo.repositories, Spring Data Repository Support>>: Provides Spring Repository support.

It is recommended SDN developers also familiarise themselves with the OGM. The OGM reference documentation has been reproduced after this
section for convenience.
