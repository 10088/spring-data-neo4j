= Spring Data

http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data] is a SpringSource project that aims to provide Spring's convenient
programming model and well known conventions for NOSQL databases.
Currently there is support for graph (Neo4j), key-value (Redis), document (MongoDB) and relational (JPA) databases.

The Spring Data Neo4j (SDN for short) project, as part of the Spring Data initiative, aims to simplify development with the Neo4j graph
database.
Like JPA, SDN uses annotations on simple POJO domain objects which it then stores as metadata which in turn helps it to drive
mapping into entities and their fields to nodes, relationships, and properties into and from the graph database.
